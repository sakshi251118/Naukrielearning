                At Naukri Learning, we are committed to ensuring that our customers have a positive and fair
                    experience. We understand that plans can change, and we offer the following refund policy:

            <ul>

                    <p>
                         Full Refund: If you decide to cancel your order before taking the pre-board examination, you are
                        entitled to get a full refund. To process this, please inform us of your decision, and we will initiate
                        a refund to your original source of payment or the same payment method you used. The refund process may
                        take 7 to 10 business days to complete.

                    <p>
                        No Refund: Once you have appeared for the pre-board examination, you will no longer be eligible for a
                        refund. This policy helps us maintain the integrity of our examination process and ensure that all
                        candidates are treated equally.
